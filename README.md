## Description
This application allows the user to log a burger or multiple burgers of their choice, and then devour each burger.  It was created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM following the MVC design pattern.

## Usage
To name a burger the user enters their text into the html input.  When they finish and click the 'Add Burger' button their burger is then rendered to a column titled 'Have a Taste!'. Beside the burger is a button labeled 'Gobble me down!' so the user can then eat the burger.  Once it has been eaten the corresponding burger is then moved to the 'Clean Plate Club!' column.
